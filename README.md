# Timetable Scheduling Program
This is a Timetable Scheduling Program for a high school, which stores students, teachers and courses to make timetables for both teachers and students using the Genetic Algorithm.

I made this project with two of my fellow class mates for our final project in Grade 12 Computer Science.
